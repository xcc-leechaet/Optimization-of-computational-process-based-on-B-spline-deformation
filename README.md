# Optimization-of-computational-process-based-on-B-spline-deformation
In mutual information based B-spline deformation, it seems common to compute the analytical solution by kernel density estimation, but I tried to compute the numerical solution. Each control point grid can only affect pixel points within the surrounding 4*4 grid area, and each pixel point is also only affected by the nearest 4*4 grid points. Based on this reasoning, after updating the weights of a single control point grid, if you want to calculate the offset change of a pixel point, the best way to do it is to only calculate the pixel points within the 4*4 grid that are affected by it. But in this case, each pixel point has to calculate the impact from the 4*4 total of 16 grid point weights. By a simple step, we only need to calculate the impact of updating the grid weights of the control point while preserving the original offset, instead of calculating the impact of the 16 grids.
